<center> <h2>A Workshop Prepared for the 2018 Annual Meeting of the <a href="https://freshwater-science.org/"> Society for Freshwater Science</a></h2> </center>

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course you should be able to do the following in R:
* [Read, manipulate, query, and write vector (point, line, polygon) data](/sfs-r-gis-2018/modules/vector data/intro-vector-data-r/)
* [Read, manipulate, query, and write raster data](/sfs-r-gis-2018/modules/rasters/introduction/)
* [Combine several data layers and data types to conduct spatial analyses, including joins, clips, and summaries](/sfs-r-gis-2018/modules/spatial operations/Introduction/)
* [Map and visualize spatial data as static or interactive features](/sfs-r-gis-2018/modules/mapping/basic-mapping/)

## Testing installations

Once everything is installed, follow the instructions below to test your installation.

**1. Open RStudio**
Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu.  Start up RStudio.  Once running it should look something like:

![RStudio Window]({{site.baseurl}}/img/rstudio.png)

**2. Find "Console" window**
By default the console window will be on the left side of RStudio.  Find that window.  It will looking something like:  

![RStudio Console]({{site.baseurl}}/img/rstudio_console.png)

**3. Copy and paste the code**
Click in the window and paste in the code from below:

```r
version$version.string
```

It should say (or slightly older version OK)...

```r

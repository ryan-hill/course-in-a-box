<title>plotly and Mapview</title>

<script src="../../../js/hideoutput.js"></script>



We've seen how to use some of the basic plotting features in R to create static maps in the last two sub-modules.  Although static maps are still the de facto format for publications, interact with the plot data can be much more informative.  R is no longer limited to static plotting since several new package have been introduced in the last few years.  Most of these packages link R code to existing plotting libraries that were developed in other languages (e.g., JavaScript).  These are not new packages in the computing world, just new to the R universe.  They are insanely easy to use if you know just a bit of R code and they interface really well with R Markdown.  

We'll introduce the following packages in this submodule:

<ul>
<li>[plotly](https://plot.ly/r/): interactive graphs in R, not limited to maps</li>
<li>[mapview](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview): quick interactive maps to examine eand visually investigate geometries and attributes of spatial data</li>
</ul>

The plotly library lets you easily create interactive plots in R.

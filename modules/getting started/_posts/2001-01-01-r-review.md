## A Quick Review of R

---

Before the workshop, it will be useful to review some R basics as well as types of R data structures, methods, and how to learn more about each. GIS in R uses data structures that will be different from what you are used to, so it is useful to review how to access information about their characteristics.

### Terminology - working directory

Working directory in R is the location on your computer R is working from.  To determine your working directory, in console type:

```r
getwd()
```

Which should return something like:

```r
[1] "/home/ryan/sfs-r-gis-2018"
```

To see what is in the directory:
```r
dir()
```

To establish a different directory:
```r
setwd("/home/ryan/some-other-directory")
```

### Terminology - data structures
R has a number of data structures (vectors, matrices, arrays, data frames, lists) and extensible objects (regression models, time-series, geospatial coordinates). 

To learn about objects, become friends with the built-in `class` and `str` functions. Let's explore the built-in iris data set to start:

```r
class(iris)
```

```r
[1] "data.frame"
```

```r
str(iris)
```

```r
'data.frame':	150 obs. of  5 variables:
$ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
$ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
$ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
$ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
$ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```
As we can see, `iris` is a data frame. Data frames consist of rows of observations  on columns of values for variables of interest - they are one of the fundamental and most important data structures in R. 

But as we see in the result of str(iris) above, following the information that iris is a data frame with 150 observations of 5 variables, we get information on each of the variables, in this case that 4 are numeric and one is a factor with three levels.

First off, R has several main data types:

* logical
* integer
* double
* complex
* character
* raw
* list
* NULL
* closure (function)
* special
* builtin (basic functions and operators)
* environment
* S4 (some S4 objects)
* others you won't run into at user level

We can ask what data type something is using `typeof`:
```r
typeof(iris)
```
```r
[1] "list"
```
```r
typeof(iris$Sepal.Length)
```
```r
[1] "double"
```
```r
typeof(iris$Specis)
```
```r
[1] "integer"
```

We see a couple interesting things here - `iris`, which we just said is a data frame, is a data type of `list`.  `Sepal.Length` is data type `double`, and in `str(iris)` we saw it was numeric - that makes sense - but we see that `Species` is data type `integer`, and in `str(iris)` we were told this variable was a factor with three levels.  What's going on here?

First off, `class` refers to the abstract type of an object in R, whereas `typeof` or `mode` refer to how an object is stored in memory. So iris is an object of class `data.frame`, but it is stored in memory as a list (i.e. each column is an item in a list).  Note that this allows data frames to have columns of different classes, whereas a matrix needs to be all of the same mode.

For our `Species` column, We see it's `mode` is numeric, it's `typeof` is `integer`, and it's class is `factor`.  Nominal variables in R are treated as a vector of integers 1:k,  where k is the number of unique values of that nominal variable and a mapping of the character strings to these integer values.  

This allows us to quickly see see all the unique values of a particular nominal variable or quickly re-asign a level of a nominal variable to a new value - remember, everything in R is in memory, so don't worry about tweaking the data!:
```r
levels(iris$Species)
levels(iris$Species)[1] <- 'sibirica'
```

See if you can explain how that re-asignment we just did worked.

To access particular columns in a data frame, as we saw above, we use the `$` operator - we can see the value for `Species` for each observation in `iris by doing:
```r
iris$Species
```

To access particular columns or rows of a data frame, we use indexing:
```r
iris[1,3] # the 1st row and the 3rd column
```
```r
[1] 1.4
```
```r
iris[4,5] # the 4th row and the 5th column
```
```r
[1] sibirica
Levels: sibirica versicolor virginica
```

A handy function is `names`, which you can use to get or to set data frame variable names:
```r
names(iris)
names(iris)[1] <- 'Length of Sepal'
```

Explain what this last line did

### Overview of Classes and Methods

- Class: object types
    - `class()`: gives the class type 
    - `typeof()`: information on how the object is stored
    - `str()`: how the object is structured
- Method: generic functions
    - `print()`
    - `plot()`
    - `summary()`

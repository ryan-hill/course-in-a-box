### What is R Mardown?

During the workshop, we will be using R Mardown within RStudio. Mardown is a version of markup language that can be translated into an HTML file. RStudio added the additional feature that you can run R code within the markdown document to integrate your descriptions of the analysis, R code, and R output into a single HTML. R Markdown documents can be easily shared with others or submitted with manuscripts as an appendix ([example here](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Feap.1617&attachmentId=2187835387)) to provide open and transparent methods. Here, we'll walk through an example of how to make an R Markdown document.
